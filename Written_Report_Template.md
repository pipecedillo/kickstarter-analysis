# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This analysis is to help a playwriter named Louise get a clear view about making a crowdfunding campaing.
### Purpose
The purpose was to analyze all the data she's had during the years through excel to help her set her campaign to mirror other successfull ones she's had.
## Analysis and Challenges
For me it was very important to filter the data so I could double check if I was on the right path. Sometimes it was quite difficult because it was too much data but thanks to the skills I have learned I could make my way through.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The months of May, June and July are the best months to launch a playwrite at a theater.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
People tend to help the crowdfunding when they aren't so expensive. The majority of the projects were done with less than $10,0000.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
We didn't had all the data from scratch, but thanks to the skills I learned I could take that data and acquire more data to have a more profound market research about Louise's playwrites and use this data at her favor.
## Results
The best launch dates are in the summer months and people tend to help more her crowdfunding plays if they aren't so expensive.
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
